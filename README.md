# machine-learning-reu

During my time as a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) intern, I had the chance to work with machine learning (ML).

I used ML to detect hardware trojans using frequency data from different ring-oscilators (ROs). In this project, I used 6 different machine learning models, 3 using 

Simple Vector Machines (SVMs) and 3 using Random Forest. These models were created in Jupyter Notebook using Sci-kit.

# installations

First, install Anaconda at (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Then, you can launch Jupyter Notebook in your command shell (jupyter notebook)
